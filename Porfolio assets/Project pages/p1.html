            <H1> <em>LjusVerket</em> <br> a line of lamps designed to bring a touch of warmth and uniqueness to our homes.</H1>
            <div>
                <p>I began with some sketches. For my first lamp, I liked the idea of creating something that cast a silloute and had natural feel to it.
                    To acheive this I decided to model a lamp that laser-cut patterns into and shine a light behind.
                </p>

            <div>
                <img src="/Porfolio assets/Images/projectImg/Lamps/Geodesketch.png" alt="A sketch and reference photos of my geode lamp">
                <p>commiting to my nature theme, for my second lamp I wanted to create something that mimicked a geode one might find deep within the earth. 
                    Because of its extruding jagged structure, I decided that using a 3d printer would be the best way to fabricate this lamp. </p>
            </div>
            <p>Next I began modeling the lamps in SketchUp. It was first time using any sort of CAD so I decided to start with something very basic and user friendly</p>
            <div>
                <img src="/Porfolio assets/Images/projectImg/Lamps/BoxPerFront.png" alt="A sketch and reference photos for my box lamp">
                <img src="/Porfolio assets/Images/projectImg/Lamps/GeodePerTopExplode.png" alt="A sketch and reference photos for my box lamp">
            </div>
            <p>After I finished modeling I moved on to fabrication. The geode styled lamp came out great on the first try. However the laser-cutter struggled to cut all the way 
                through they MDF I had bought. After a couple trials and errors I found piece of wood that the laser could handel and had to replace the leaf pattern on alternating sides
                with the block pattern.
            </p>
