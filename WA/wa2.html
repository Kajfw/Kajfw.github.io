    <p><strong>Pronouns: </strong><i>He/Him/His</i></p>
    <p><strong>About me: </strong> I was born and raised in <i>Boulder, CO</i>. My mother grew up in a small town in sweden. 
        My twin brother and I are both fluent in swedish, and studied aboroad in <i>Linkoping, Sweden</i> our sophmore year 
        of highschool. After graduating from highschool, we took a gapyear and backbacked across Africa, Asia and Europe. 
        After our year off we enrolled at CU Boulder. Origionally I was planning to get my undergrad in Computer Science,
        but decided to switch my major to Creative Technology and Design because I felt it alligned more with my passion for 
        creative work while still allowing me to work closely with technology.</p>
